## Calculator
#### 

A functional calculator with Order of Operations.

BASIC OPERATIONS			\
`addition	      | 1 + 2 =	-> 3	`\
`multiplication	| 1 * 2 =	-> 2	`\
`division	      | 1 / 2 =	-> 0.5	`\
`subtraction	    | 1 - 2 = -> -1	` 
 
COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS    \
`successive operations	| 1 + 1 + 2 =	-> 4	`\
`decimals	            | 1 . 1 + 1 . 1 =	-> 2.2	`\
`multiple decimals	    | 1 ... 1 + 1 ... 1 = -> 2.2	`\
`multiple operations	    | 1 ++++ 2 = -> 3	`\
`changing operations	    | 1 + - * 2 =	-> 2	`\
`operation repeat	    | 1 + 1 = = =	-> 4	`\
`operation rollover	    | 1 + 1 + = + = -> 8	`\
`division by zero	    | 1 / 0	= "Cannot divide by zero"	`\
`all clear               | 4 * 5 = AC -> 0 `

ADVANCED OPERATIONS			\
`premature operation |	++++ 1 * 3 = -> 3	`\
`missing operation	  | 3 =	-> 3	`\
`partial operand	    | 3 * =	-> 9	`\
`missing operands	  | = = = =	-> 0 `

`order of operations |	1 + 3 / 4 + 10 * 2	= -> 21.75	`\
`clear               | 4 * 10 C 5 * C 2 = -> 40 `\
`backspace           | 4 * 10 ← 5 * 10 ← = -> 60 `\
`plus/minus          | 4 ± + 4 ± = -> -8 `\
`binary rounding     | 0.1 + 0.2 -> 0.3 (not 0.300000004) `
